Hozier,Unreal Unearth,2023,De Selby (Part 1),"At last. When all of the world is asleep. You take in the blackness of air. The likes of a darkness so deep. That God, at the start, couldn't bear. And sit unseen. With only the inner upheld. Your reflection can't offer a word. To the bliss of not knowing yourself. With all mirroring gone from the world. But, still, the mind. Rejecting this new empty space. Fills it with something or someone. No closer could I be to God. Or why He would do what He's done. Bhfuilis soranna sorcha. Ach tagais 'nós na hoíche. Trína chéile. Le chéile, claochlaithe. Bhfuilis soranna sorcha. Ach tagais 'nós na hoíche is claochlú an ealaín. Is ealaín dubh í."
Hozier,Unreal Unearth,2023,De Selby (Part 2),"What you're given, what you live in. Darlin', it finds a way to live in you. And your heart, love, has such darkness. I feel it in the corners of the room. I want to be when you fall on me like night. Every time. And I want to be so far from sight and mind. I wanna kill the lights. I wanna run against the world that's turnin'. I'd move so fast that I'd outpace the dawn. I wanna be gone. I wanna run so far, I'd beat the mornin'. And before the dawn has come, I'd block the Sun. If you want it done. Let all time slow, let all everything go. I don't need to know where we begin and I end. I only need to know how the work of your hands. Is a movement so gentle and kind."
Hozier,Unreal Unearth,2023,First Time,"And the first time that you called me baby. I felt like I was born. I had a sense of being. Something that I'd never felt before. And the first time that you kissed me. I drank dry the river Lethe. The Liffey would have been softer on my stomach all the same. As it was and ever shall be, unearth without a name. Some part of me must have died. The first time that you called me baby. And some part of me came alive. The first time that you called me baby. These days I think I owe my life. To flowers that were left here by my mother. Ain't that like them? Giftin' life to you again. Infinitely suffering, but fighting off like all creation. The absence of itself, anyway. Some part of me must have died. Each time that you called me baby. But some part of me stayed alive. Each time that you called."
Hozier,Unreal Unearth,2023,Francesca,"Do you think I'd give up? That I'd live it all again. Now that I know what's left of the edge of what I am. My life was a storm, since I was born. How could I fear any hurricane? If someone asked me at the end. I'd tell them put me back in it. Darlin', I would do it again. If I could hold you for a minute. Darlin', I'd go through it again. I would still be your man. I would still be your man. I would still be your man. Heaven is not fit to house a love like you and I. I would go anywhere. I would walk through the fire. I would still be your man."
Hozier,Unreal Unearth,2023,I Carrion (Icarian),"If I should fall, spirit or soul. If I should backslide into the black glide. Of the blue ocean floor. I'm through being chill. If I should fly, forget the sky. 'Cause I'm on your shoulder, I'm already over. And I'm looking down. I'm through being still. You're the heavy weight of it. You're the heavy weight of it, love. If I should fall, I'd fall with you. I'd fall with you. If I should fall, I'd fall with you. I'd fall with you. I'm through being still. If I should fly, forget the sky. 'Cause I'm on your shoulder, I'm already over. And I'm looking down. I'm through being still."
Hozier,Unreal Unearth,2023,Eat Your Young,"Honey, check the price. Burn it for the light. Tell me what's worth it. To keep your hands cold. And your heart gold. Tell me what's worth it. Seven new ways that you can eat your young. Come and get some. Skinned and grilled or served on the bone. Come and get some. Pull up a chair and let the work be done. Seven new ways that you can eat your young. Come and get some. Skinned and grilled or served on the bone. Come and get some. Pull up a chair and let the work be done."
Hozier,Unreal Unearth,2023,Damage Gets Done (Ft. Brandi Carlile),"I know I've been a lot to take. I know I've been a lot to lose. We were young and we were wrong. We were just doing what we had to do. And the damage gets done. And the damage gets done. We had no idea what we were doing. We were just doing what we had to do. I know I've been a lot to take. I know I've been a lot to lose. But the damage gets done. And the damage gets done."
Hozier,Unreal Unearth,2023,Who We Are,"You and I, burned by the sun. You and I, we've only just begun. It isn't heaven, it isn't hell. It's just who we are. It's just who we are. Someone is screaming in the dark. Someone is looking for a spark. It isn't heaven, it isn't hell. It's just who we are. It's just who we are. To hold you like a water lily. To hold you like a morning star. It's just who we are."
Hozier,Unreal Unearth,2023,Son of Nyx,"[Instrumental]"
Hozier,Unreal Unearth,2023,All Things End,"A movement of the sun. A turning of the page. A moment of the heart. A change of the age. All things end. All things end. All things end. All things end. We begin again. We begin again. We begin again. We begin again. Darling, we're not meant to last. We're just meant to be. And the end of the world is just a change of scene. All things end. All things end."
Hozier,Unreal Unearth,2023,To Someone From a Warm Climate (Uiscefhuarithe),"The warmth that you've given me. The way that you've been with me. It's like a dream. It's like a dream. Uiscefhuarithe. The way it's always been. The way it's always been. It's the coldness of the water. It's the coldness of the rain. It's the coldness of the winter. It's the coldness of the pain. But you're the warmth. You're the warmth."
Hozier,Unreal Unearth,2023,Butchered Tongue,"A butchered tongue. It's still a tongue. It's the only one I've got. It's the only one I've got. And I'll sing it. And I'll sing it. Until the end. Until the end. With a butchered tongue. In a world that's gone. I'll sing my song. I'll sing my song."
Hozier,Unreal Unearth,2023,Anything But,"I wanna be the shadow when the bright light hits. I wanna be the garden when the winter lets in. I wanna be the sunshine when the rain begins. I'd be anything but me. I'd be anything but me. If I could be a riot, I'd be a quiet. I'd be a riot, I'd be a quiet. I'd be anything but. I'd be anything but."
Hozier,Unreal Unearth,2023,Abstract (Psychopomp),"The memory of the sound. The way the light would hit the ground. I'm terrified. I'm terrified. Darling, I'm terrified. The way the world would spin around. The way the stars would look at us. I'm terrified. I'm terrified. Darling, I'm terrified. It's the memory of the sound."
Hozier,Unreal Unearth,2023,Unknown / Nth,"You know the distance of the sun. You know the way the world is run. And I'm an unknown. I'm an unknown. You know the way the river flows. You know the way the garden grows. And I'm an unknown. I'm an unknown. I'm the nth degree. I'm the nth degree of an unknown."
Hozier,Unreal Unearth,2023,First Light,"The darkness that I knew. The way the world would look at you. I'm seein' the first light. I'm seein' the first light. It's the end of the night. It's the start of the day. I'm seein' the first light. I'm seein' the first light. Everything is new. Everything is bright. I'm seein' the first light."
Harry Styles,Harry's House,2022,Music for a Sushi Restaurant,"Green eyes, fried rice, I could cook an egg on you. Late night, game time, coffee on the stove, seashells. You're sweet ice cream, but you could use a Flake or two. If the stars were edible and our hearts were never full. Could we live with just a taste? Talk it out. Summertime, it's a love affair. I'm in love with you."
Harry Styles,Harry's House,2022,Late Night Talking,"Things haven't been quite the same. There's a haze on the horizon, baby. It's only been a couple of days and I miss you. When nothing really goes to plan. You lose the pass and you lose the hand. We've been doing all this late night talking. If you're feeling down, I just wanna make you happier, baby."
Harry Styles,Harry's House,2022,Grapejuice,"Yesterday, it was fine. The sun was out, it was high. I was sipping on a little bit of grapejuice. How much of it do I need? The morning's arrived, and I'm feeling it now. I'm just a little bit pink. 1982, was it good? I was thinking about you."
Harry Styles,Harry's House,2022,As It Was,"Holdin' me back. Gravity's holdin' me back. I want you to hold out the palm of your hand. Why don't we leave it at that? Nothin' to say. When everything gets in the way. Seems you cannot be replaced. And I'm the one who will stay, oh. In this world, it's just us. You know it's not the same as it was."
Harry Styles,Harry's House,2022,Daylight,"If I was a bluebird, I would fly to you. You'd be the spoon. Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you. Daylight, you got me cursing at the daylight. You've got me calling at all times. Ain't nobody here but you and me."
Harry Styles,Harry's House,2022,Little Freak,"Little freak, Jezebel. You sit on your tea tray, starin' at the stars. I'm not worried about where you are or who you will go home to. I'm just thinkin' about you. You never saw my birthmark. I was thinking about who you are. Your delicate point of view."
Harry Styles,Harry's House,2022,Matilda,"Matilda, you talk of the pain like it's all alright. But I know that you feel like you've got no one to call tonight. You can let it go. You can throw a party full of everyone you know. And not invite your family, 'cause they never showed you love. You don't have to be sorry for leaving and growing up."
Harry Styles,Harry's House,2022,Cinema,"I just think you're cool. I dig your cinema. Do you think I'm cool too? Or am I too into you? It's your pop, coming icons. Tell me what you're thinking now. You got the cinema. I could eat your mouth. I could get used to this."
Harry Styles,Harry's House,2022,Daydreaming,"Living in a daydream. She said, 'Love me like you paid me'. You know I'll be gone for a minute. So give me all your love, give me something to dream about. Stay until the morning. 'Cause baby, loving you's the real thing."
Harry Styles,Harry's House,2022,Keep Driving,"Black-and-white film, camera, Side B. Hash brown, egg yolk, window down, tea. Coke on Top, pancakes, hash browns, side of ham. Life is a highway, I'm gonna ride it all night long. Should we just keep driving? Maple syrup, coffee, pancakes, hash browns. Passport, luggage, sunshine, headphones."
Harry Styles,Harry's House,2022,Satellite,"You're in the blue, and I'm in the red. Spinning out, waiting for you to pull me in. I'm in an orbit about you. I can see you're lonely down there. Don't you know that I'm right here? I'm spinning out, waiting for you. I go round and round."
Harry Styles,Harry's House,2022,Boyfriends,"Boyfriends, they think they're so easy. They take you for granted. They don't know they're just lucky to be with you. You open the door for them, and they walk right through. You're loveable, you're reachable. But they don't know that. They're just boyfriends."
Harry Styles,Harry's House,2022,Love Of My Life,"Baby, you were the love of my life. Maybe you were the love of my life. It's unfortunate. Just a memory, it's a dream. I'm not going to find you again. But you were the love of my life. You were the love of my life."
Florence + The Machine,Dance Fever,2022,King,"I am no mother, I am no bride, I am a king. I need my golden crown of sorrow, my bloody sword to swing. My arm around my empty shoulder, how could I tell you? I'm as hollow as a hall. But you need me to be yours, you need me to be yours. And I was never as good as I thought I was, but I knew how to dress it up."
Florence + The Machine,Dance Fever,2022,Free,"I'm always radiating anxiety. That's why I'm always moving. It feels like someone's reached into my chest and they're just squeezing.

Florence + The Machine,Dance Fever,2022,Choreomania,"And I am thinking about how much I miss you. And I am thinking about how much I need to dance. Something is coming, I can feel it in the air.

Florence + The Machine,Dance Fever,2022,Back in Town,"Never really been a resident, just a frequent visitor. I'm back in town, I'm back in town. And I'm looking for the ghost of a love that I once knew. The streets are all the same, but the faces have all changed. I'm back in town, and I'm looking for you."
Florence + The Machine,Dance Fever,2022,Girls Against God,"I know I was complaining that there was nothing to do. But I didn't mean it, I was just bored and I was confused. And then the world stopped turning, and I was alone with my thoughts. And I started a fight with God, yeah, I started a fight with God."
Florence + The Machine,Dance Fever,2022,Dream Girl Evil,"Am I your dream girl? Or am I your girl dream? Am I the thing you love? Or the thing you fear? I'm not your mother, I'm not your sister, I'm not your friend. I'm the one who's going to break you in the end. Dream girl evil, dream girl evil."
Florence + The Machine,Dance Fever,2022,Prayer Factory,"I put my prayers in a factory, I make them by the ton. I send them out to everyone, but I don't get any back. It's a lonely business, being a saint. It's a lonely business, trying to be what you're not. I'm just a cog in the machine."
Florence + The Machine,Dance Fever,2022,Cassandra,"I used to look to the future, but now I'm just trying to stay in the present. And I can see the towers coming down, and I can hear the sound of the world ending. But no one is listening, no one is looking. I'm just a prophet who's lost her voice. Cassandra, you were right all along. Every day I'm waking up, and the sky is a different color of blue."
Florence + The Machine,Dance Fever,2022,Heaven Is Here,"And every song I wrote became a crystal ball. I could see the future, and it was beautiful. But it was also terrible. Heaven is here, if you want it. But you have to be willing to burn for it. I'm not afraid of the fire, I'm not afraid of the dark. I'm just a girl with a heart of gold."
Florence + The Machine,Dance Fever,2022,Daffodil,"There is a flower that grows in the dark. It doesn't need the sun, it doesn't need the rain. It just needs a little bit of love, a little bit of pain. Daffodil, you're the only one who knows. You're the only one who sees. The world is a garden of shadows, and we're just the weeds."
Florence + The Machine,Dance Fever,2022,My Love,"Tell me what you want me to do. I'll do anything for you. My love is a wild thing, it's a dangerous thing. It'll keep you up at night, it'll make you scream. But it's the only thing that's real. My love, my love, my love. It's a fever that never goes away."
Florence + The Machine,Dance Fever,2022,Restraint,"I'm learning how to keep it inside. I'm learning how to hide the pain. Restraint, it's a beautiful thing. It's a quiet thing. I'm not going to let you see me cry. I'm not going to let you see me break. I'm just a statue in a park, waiting for the rain to wash me away."
Florence + The Machine,Dance Fever,2022,The Bomb,"I'm a ticking time bomb, and I'm about to go off. I'm a disaster waiting to happen. But you're the only one who can stop me. You're the only one who can save me. The bomb is inside of me, and it's getting louder every day. I'm just a girl with a heart of glass."
Florence + The Machine,Dance Fever,2022,Morning Elvis,"I'm waking up in a hotel room, and I don't know where I am. I'm looking for the ghost of Elvis, but he's nowhere to be found. It's the morning after the night before, and I'm feeling like a wreck. But I'm still standing, I'm still breathing. Morning Elvis, give me a sign."
